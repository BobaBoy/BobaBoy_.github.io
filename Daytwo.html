<h1> Today's Post </h1>

<p> Today I look foward to advancing into the process of making a website,
so far it has been very intruiging. Today I learned how to link my Day 2 blog
to my Day 1 blog. I also look foward to continue working on my
3D model in musical robots, though the process can be somewhat frusturating. </p>
